## Overview of Changes

**Important Note**: All changes documented here were **refinements and bug fixes** to ensure the originally designed features work correctly. **No new features were added** beyond the initial scope. Every modification was necessary to make the application function as originally intended.

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Auto-Call Mode Default Setting Fix

**Issue**: New rooms were incorrectly defaulting to auto-call mode enabled, contradicting the intended manual mode default.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/supabase-service.ts`
- `src/pages/host-setup.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (Bug)
autoCall: {
  enabled: true  // Incorrectly defaulted to auto mode
}

// After (Fixed)
autoCall: {
  enabled: false  // Correctly defaults to manual mode
}
```

**Rationale**: The original design intended manual mode as the default to give hosts full control. This was a configuration bug that prevented the intended behavior.

### 2. Status Bar Display Accuracy

**Issue**: Status bar showed "auto mode" even when games were in manual mode due to incorrect state reading.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/ui/status-bar.tsx`
- `src/pages/host-dashboard.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
- Corrected status calculation logic to read actual room configuration
- Added proper state synchronization between UI and database

**Rationale**: Users needed accurate feedback about game mode. Incorrect status display would confuse hosts about their game settings.

### 3. Real-time Configuration Sync

**Issue**: Host dashboard controls (auto mode toggle, pause, frequency) weren't persisting to database, causing desync between UI and actual game state.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/host-dashboard.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added database persistence to all control toggles
const toggleAutoMode = async () => {
  setIsAutoMode(!isAutoMode);
  
  // NEW: Persist to database
  const newConfig = {
    ...room.config,
    autoCall: { enabled: !isAutoMode }
  };
  await SupabaseService.updateRoomConfig(room.id, newConfig);
};
```

**Rationale**: Game controls must persist across sessions and be synchronized across all clients. Without database persistence, settings would be lost on refresh.

### 4. Auto-Call Timer Edge Cases

**Issue**: Auto-call timer continued running when no numbers were available, causing unnecessary processing.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/host-dashboard.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added check for available numbers
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isAutoMode || isPaused || winnerPlayers.length > 0 || availableNumbers.length === 0) return;
  // Timer logic...
}, [isAutoMode, isPaused, autoInterval, winnerPlayers.length, availableNumbers.length]);
```

**Rationale**: Prevents unnecessary timer execution and potential errors when game is complete.

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Reduced Console Logging

**Issue**: Excessive console logging in production affecting performance and cluttering browser console.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/host-dashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/player-game.tsx`
- `src/utils/myngo-utils.ts`

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed production console.log statements
- Kept only essential error logging
- Added conditional verbose logging for debugging

**Rationale**: Production applications should have minimal console output for better performance and cleaner debugging experience.

### 2. Memoization of Expensive Calculations

**Issue**: Winner detection and player status calculations were running on every render.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/host-dashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/player-game.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added memoization for expensive calculations
const nearWinPlayers = useMemo(() => {
  return players.filter(player => {
    if (!player.card || !player.marked_numbers) return false;
    return isCloseToWin(player.card, player.marked_numbers);
  });
}, [players]);

const winnerPlayers = useMemo(() => {
  return players.filter(player => player.is_winner === true);
}, [players]);
```

**Rationale**: Prevents unnecessary recalculations and improves UI responsiveness, especially with many players.

### 3. Optimized Real-time Subscription Management

**Issue**: Potential memory leaks from improper subscription cleanup.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/hooks/use-myngo-room.ts`

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive cleanup in useEffect return functions
- Implemented proper subscription state tracking
- Added mounted component checks to prevent state updates on unmounted components

**Rationale**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures stable real-time connections.

## UI/UX Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Winner Statistics Display

**Issue**: Winner statistics text was too small and hard to read on mobile devices.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/host-dashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/player-game.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Increased font size for better readability
<div className="text-white font-bold text-xl">{players.length}</div>
// Previously: text-lg
```

**Rationale**: Improved accessibility and readability, especially on mobile devices where users celebrate wins.

### 2. Auto-focus on Room Code Input

**Issue**: Users had to manually click the room code input field when joining games.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/join-game.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added auto-focus to room code input
const roomCodeInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (roomCodeInputRef.current) {
    roomCodeInputRef.current.focus();
  }
}, []);
```

**Rationale**: Improves user experience by reducing friction in the join process.

### 3. Responsive Design Enhancements

**Issue**: Some components weren't properly responsive on mobile devices.

**Files Changed**:
- Various component files

**Fix Applied**:
- Added proper responsive breakpoints
- Improved mobile layout for game controls
- Enhanced touch targets for mobile interaction

**Rationale**: Ensures consistent experience across all device types, critical for webinar audiences using various devices.

## Manual Cleanup Implementation

### 1. Browser Navigation Cleanup

**Issue**: Players leaving via browser navigation (back button, close tab) weren't properly removed from games.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/player-game.tsx`
- `src/pages/host-dashboard.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added beforeunload event handling
useEffect(() => {
  const handleBeforeUnload = () => {
    if (navigator.sendBeacon && playerId) {
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append('action', 'remove_player');
      formData.append('playerId', playerId);
      navigator.sendBeacon('/cleanup', formData);
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
}, [playerId]);
```

**Rationale**: Essential for maintaining accurate player counts and preventing "ghost players" in games.

### 2. Session Storage Management

**Issue**: Player sessions weren't properly managed across page refreshes.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/pages/player-game.tsx`
- `src/pages/join-game.tsx`

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented proper session storage for player IDs
- Added session validation and cleanup
- Ensured proper reconnection flow

**Rationale**: Allows players to refresh their browser without losing their game session.

### 3. Automatic Game Cleanup

**Issue**: Abandoned games and demo sessions weren't being cleaned up automatically.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/supabase-service.ts`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added cleanup functions
static async cleanupDemoGames(): Promise<void> {
  const cutoffTime = new Date(Date.now() - 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString();
  await supabase
    .from('rooms')
    .delete()
    .eq('config->demoMode', true)
    .lt('created_at', cutoffTime);
}
```

**Rationale**: Prevents database bloat and ensures system resources are efficiently managed.

## Real-time Reliability Fixes
